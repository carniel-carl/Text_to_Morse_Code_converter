# Text to Morse Code Converter
**Text to morse code converter takes a text/sentence as an input then convert it to Latin Morse Code. Using '/' to signify space in the morse code.**

## Project approach.

- Included a json file of the morse code and alphabet.

- Load up the json file  in my project.

- Requested for a text input.

- Looped through the letter/character in the text and checked if the letter/character is  in the json file.

- Return the value of that letter/character from the json file.
